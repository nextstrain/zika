*****************************************************************
Path resolution of config values
*****************************************************************

Some documentation which is vendored (i.e. in the shared directory / repo) and which documents the path resolution functionality injected into workflows via ``config.smk``

Via symlinks we can include this in the repo's docs, whilst having it sourced from the shared repo and thus always in-sync with the shared code.
